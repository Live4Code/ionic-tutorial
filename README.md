Employee Directory App introduces us to build mobile app with web technology. Thanks to ionic and apache cordova, writing mobile 
app feels right at home for angular developers. 

In the Employee Directory App, ionic is UI library. We simply use its css styles to change the feel of our app. The javascript part 
is very similar to a web app.

In the following exercies, we start builing another app -- Movie App. In this app, we will introduce some javascript utilities from 
ionic. Its javascript api comes in handy to build rich functional components.

We choose to build an app about movie because the topic is familiar to most people. More importantly, the movie app represents a very 
popular purpose of mobile applications -- information displaying. 

Our movie app will show about 100 movies in recent years. It includes features such as infinite scrolling, search-as-you-type, various 
sort options and filter by user ratings. These features are very common for a information displaying app. 

Let's start building!
