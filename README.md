### The finishing remark

This marks the end of the ionic course. Hopefully you find ionic very powerful and easy to use. For more 
information, please visit <a href="http://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">Ionic Website</a> and check out their cool demos. With 
the knowlege of angular and ionic, you can start build very cool apps on your own.

### Differences between native app and hybrid app

Let's talk about differences between a native app and a hybrid app.

Building native applications means using the native language of the platform, Objective-C/Swift on iOS, and Java on Android. 

The main advantage is their performance. The drawback is you have to learn specific apis for each platform, 
and write differnt sets of code.

To be specific, Java or Objective-C/Swift are more verbose than Javascript, you often need to write much more code in native app.

Also building with the native sdks are much more difficult than building with Html5. Part of the reason is cordova alredy 
take care of the underlying work for us, so we only need to focus on the logic and presentation of our app.

To summarize, if performance is critial (for example, if you are building a game app), or if the mobile app 
is critial to your business, you should go with the native app. 

But a lot times we are building information related app. For these apps, hybrid approach is more attractive. It covers all major 
platforms, writing code against HTML5 and javascript is much easier. 

Also javascript is a very vibrant language, we see a lot of improvements on the mobile side in the last few years. 
Major companies all invest heavily in javascript to make it competitive with native languages. 

### Showcase your app

We encouge you to build upon the app we created here or use it as reference for your future projects. 

Since all the work is synchronized to your github account, you can use github to host your app by simply create a branch ```gh-pages``` and 
push to github. For more information, please visit <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>.
