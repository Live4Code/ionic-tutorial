Let's jump in and start building a real hybrid app! Along the way, you can instantly preview you app using mobile broswer or as **native app** on 
an android device! We start with a blank ionic app generated from its 
<a href="https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-starter-blank" target="_blank">starter template</a>.

## What is Ionic

From ionic website: 

> Ionic is a powerful HTML5 native app development framework that helps you build native-feeling mobile apps all with web technologies like HTML, 
CSS, and Javascript.

In summary, this is what we do to build a hybrid app:

  1. We are developing an AngularJS app. All our knowledege from angular courses will be used here.
  
  2. Ionic helps to build a native style UI.
  
  3. We build app on <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Cordova</a>, which helps to compile all our JS code to native code.
  
Luckily, Ionic hide most of the detail. As developer, we only need to focus on the Angular and HTML side of the app.

#How to learn this course

In this course, we divide chapters into different features of our app. In each chapter, there are several exercises to help build 
each feature progressively.

For each feature, we have instructions to help understand concept and initial code. Then there is exercise for you to complete the feature.

We want you to have **instant feedback** on what you are building. You can have your mobile browser or the android app we provided open 
when learning the course, when you submit an exercise or start a new one, you will see the actual app live and running on your phone.

Let's start learning!
