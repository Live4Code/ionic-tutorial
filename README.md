Let's jump in and start building a real hybrid app! Along the process, you can instantly preview you app using mobile broswer or as **native app** on an android device! 
We start with a blank ionic app generated from its <a href="https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-starter-blank" target="_blank">starter template</a>.

**What is Ionic**

From ionic website: 

> Ionic is a powerful HTML5 native app development framework that helps you build native-feeling mobile apps all with web technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

In summary, this is what we are doing to build a hybrid app for mobile devices:

  1. We are developing an AngularJS app. All our knowledege from angular courses will be used here.
  
  2. Ionic helps to build a native like UI, so when the app starts on mobile phones, it feels just like other apps.
  
  3. We are building our app on a powerful platform <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Cordova</a>, which helps to compile all our JS code to native code.
  
Luckily, Ionic hide most of its underlying details and communications with cordova. As developer, we just need to focus on the Angular and HTML side of the app.

**How to learn this course**

In this course, we divided chapters into different features of our app. In each chapter, there are several exercises to help build each feature progressively.
For each exercise, we have instructions to help understand the concept, initial code, and exercise for you to complete the feature.

We want you to have **instant feedback** on what you are building. You can have your mobile browser or the android app we made open when learning the course, when you submit exercise 
code or start a new one, you will see the actual app on your phone.

Buckle up and start the ionic jounery.
