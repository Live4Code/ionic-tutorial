**1.** In ***controllers.js***, finish the ```EmployeeDetailCtrl```, so it can get the right employee entity based on url parameter from ```EmployeeService```. 
E.g. visit ```/employees/1``` should show page about James King. Visit ```/employees/2``` should show page about Julie Taylor.

**2.** In ***employee-index.html***, add url to the ```<href>``` in ```<ion-item>```, so click a item should redirect to its employee's detail page.

**3.** Fill in the 4 ```<p>``` in ***employee-detail.html*** to show the employee's contact information.
